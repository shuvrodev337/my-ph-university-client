/**
 * Here we are converting adminPaths to adminRoutes and adminSidebarItems
 * so that we can serve both purpose with the One array.
 * 1.in routes(adminRoutes)
 * 2.in the sidebar(adminSidebarItems)
 *
 * adminPaths is the 1 array , we are converting it to make it work in both places.
 * we are using array REDUCE method to make it structured like 2 hard coded versions given in admin.routes.ts.
 *  two versions are for two places.
